## 📊 Understanding the Metrics

### FrankenPHP Worker Restart Monitoring

Worker restarts are a **critical indicator** of application health:

**Normal Restart Patterns:**
- Zero restarts during stable operation
- Occasional restarts after deployments (expected)
- Single restart after configuration changes

**Problem Indicators:**
- **Frequent restarts** (>0.1/sec) = memory leaks or crashes
- **Gradual memory growth** + restarts = memory leak
- **Sudden restart spikes** = code bugs or resource exhaustion
- **Continuous restart loop** = critical application error

**Action Items by Restart Rate:**
- **0 restarts/sec** - Healthy operation ✅
- **<0.05 restarts/sec** - Monitor, investigate patterns ⚠️
- **0.05-0.1 restarts/sec** - Review logs, check memory usage 🔍
- **>0.1 restarts/sec** - Critical issue, immediate investigation required 🚨

### Performance Indicators

**Green Indicators (Good Performance):**
- Low error rates (<1%)
- Fast response times (<100ms P95)
- High cache hit ratios (>95%)
- Low thread/process utilization (<70%)
- Empty request queues
- Zero or minimal worker restarts
- Stable memory usage

**Yellow Indicators (Warning):**
- Moderate error rates (1-5%)
- Elevated response times (100-500ms P95)
- Medium cache hit ratios (80-95%)
- Medium thread/process utilization (70-90%)
- Small request queues (1-5)
- Occasional worker restarts (<0.05/sec)
- Slowly growing memory usage

**Red Indicators (Critical Issues):**
- High error rates (>5%)
- Slow response times (>500ms P95)
- Low cache hit ratios (<80%)
- High thread/process utilization (>90%)
- Large request queues (>10)
- Frequent worker restarts (>0.1/sec)
- Rapidly growing or high memory usage

### Thread vs Worker vs Process

**FrankenPHP (Threads & Workers):**
- **Threads** - Lightweight concurrent execution units
- **Workers** - Long-lived PHP processes that handle multiple requests
- **Benefits** - Lower memory, faster request handling, shared state

**PHP-FPM (Processes):**
- **Processes** - Isolated PHP processes, one per request
- **Benefits** - Complete isolation, proven stability, easier debugging

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### High Worker Restart Rate

**Symptoms:**
- Worker Restart Rate > 0.1/sec
- Memory usage growing steadily
- Total Worker Restarts increasing rapidly

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Check application logs for PHP errors or warnings
2. Review memory usage trends - look for leaks
3. Examine recent code deployments or changes
4. Check for problematic routes or controllers
5. Review worker configuration (max_requests, memory limits)

**Common Causes:**
- Memory leaks in application code
- Insufficient memory limits
- Third-party package issues
- Circular references in objects
- Unclosed resources (DB connections, file handles)

### Low OPcache Hit Ratio

**Symptoms:**
- OPcache Hit Ratio < 95%
- Frequent cache misses
- Slow response times

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Check OPcache memory allocation
2. Review script cache capacity
3. Look for frequent cache restarts
4. Verify file modification patterns

**Solutions:**
- Increase `opcache.memory_consumption`
- Increase `opcache.max_accelerated_files`
- Disable file modification checks in production
- Review deployment process to avoid cache clears

### High Response Times

**Symptoms:**
- P95 Response Time > 500ms
- Slow average response times
- Request queue building up

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Check database query performance
2. Review external API calls
3. Examine CPU and memory usage
4. Look for N+1 query problems
5. Check for blocking operations

**Solutions:**
- Optimize slow database queries
- Add database indexes
- Implement caching strategies
- Use async processing for heavy tasks
- Scale worker/process count

### Thread/Process Saturation

**Symptoms:**
- Thread/Process Utilization > 90%
- Growing request queue
- Increased response times

**Solutions:**
- Increase worker/process count
- Optimize slow requests
- Implement request queueing
- Scale horizontally (more servers)
- Review and optimize slow endpoints

   - Check worker restart patterns
   - Monitor memory trends
   - Validate cache performance

3. **Performance baselines**:
   - Document normal operating ranges
   - Track P50/P95 response times
   - Monitor request rates
   - Establish memory usage baselines

### Optimization Workflow

1. **Identify bottlenecks** using dashboards
2. **Investigate** specific metrics and trends
3. **Test solutions** in staging environment
4. **Deploy changes** with monitoring
5. **Validate improvements** with metrics
6. **Document findings** and solutions
